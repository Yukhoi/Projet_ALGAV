# Devoir de programmation - Algorithmique Avanc√©e  

---
The goal of the problem is to generate reduced, ordered binary decision tree diagrams with an approach similar to that presented in Newton and Vera's paper - A Theoretical and Numerical Analysis of the Worst-Case Size of Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams
---
To run the program: `python main.py`
